All the top tips for Enlisted on xbox series X and PS5.

## Best Weapons

The best weapons, especiallyon defensive maps, are probably not what you think. Is it the Condors MG, the Browning A6 or T20 rifle?

All good choices but the most powerful 3 weapons in terms of actually winning the game are as follows -

*   Engineers hammer
    
*   Barbed wire
    
*   Spotting or "pinging" system
    

Let's look at each one in more detail and show how these strange choices will actually help you to win any game of enlisted more than the best assault rifle, LMG or Tank would.

### Engineers hammer

The hammer used by the engineer is a key piece of kit. No you can't physically hit people with it unfortunately. But what you can do is use it to create machine gun nests, rally points bringing the whole army to the enemy's doorstep and most importantly, creating the single most deadly weapon in the game.

### Barbed wire

This will win a defensive game with only one piece placed, if you pick the right spot.
